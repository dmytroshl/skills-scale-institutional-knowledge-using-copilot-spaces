# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the central repository of OctoAcme's project management processes and practice documentation.

## Overview of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme applies a structured lifecycle to all projects, designed to ensure predictable, customer-centered delivery and continuous learning. Projects progress through several stages: **Initiation**, where the business need, stakeholders, and goals are defined via a Project One-pager and supporting artifacts; **Planning**, which involves breaking down work into prioritized backlogs, mapping key milestones, and proactively managing risk; **Execution**, managed day-to-day on a project board with regular standups, syncs, and a PR-driven development process emphasizing clear acceptance criteria and automated testing; **Release**, following clear protocols for deployment, verification, and stakeholder communication; and **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**, where the team captures learnings and tracks action items for future cycles.

Key workflows ensure visibility and ownership, with clear roles: Product Managers own outcomes, Project Managers focus on delivery and risk, Developers deliver features and maintain code quality, and QA/Test validates acceptance. Communication is managed through daily standups, weekly syncs, PM-to-PdM alignment meetings, and monthly stakeholder updates. A Definition of Done, automated CI, security scans, smoke testing, and thorough retrospective review all underpin strong quality assurance.
